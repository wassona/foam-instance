# 2020-08-15T13:16:58.675Z Partially Private Foam
A message I sent Bryan, Andrew, and Travis:
"I was just struck by stupid inspiration. I'm playing around with the (very early stages) note-taking app Foam (https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) and was thinking that, if I actually got into something like this, I might want to use it as a public pseudo-blog and I might want to use it as a personal journal, and I don't see why it can't do both.
But, like I said, it's very early stages. So I was trying to think of how that could be implemented given that users will want everything backed up on github, and I thought of encrypting private notes, but that seems wonky, probably bad, and definitely outside my area of expertise. Then I thought of adding a marker in private notes' names so they can be caught by a .gitignore, but of course then they won't be tracked, so the notes that are potentially the most important are also the most fragile.
Then I had my stupid inspiration: what if the one directory could be version controlled by two git instances, one gitignoring all private notes, the other gitignoring all public notes, and both sharing the plumbing?
It is dumb and probably unworkable, but I like the idea. In the course of explaining it, I realized that it would probably be much easier to accomplish the same goal with a [[git submodule]], so I might have solved my problem."
